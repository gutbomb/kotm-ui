				<h3>Kids On The Move Volunteer Consent</h3>
				<p>As a volunteer at Kids On The Move (KOTM), I understand that my volunteer position may require close contact interaction with someone who may or may not be aware that they have COVID-19. I also understand that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>KOTM is following CDC and Utah Department of Health guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and has established protocols for ensuring my safety when I come into contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19, when that information is made known to KOTM.</li>
					<li>KOTM will preserve my COVID-19 HIPAA-related information to the extent possible, and I acknowledge that KOTMâ€™s need to share my COVID-19 information with others (on a need-toknow basis) will happen as a protection to the broader community.</li>
					<li>While KOTM requires staff, clients, volunteers and the general public to respond to a health screening prior to interaction, anyone could choose to respond falsely and thus expose others to an increased risk for contracting COVID-19. I will not hold KOTM liable due to somebody who falsely represents their conditions on the health screening.</li>
					<li>COVID-19 has a long incubation period during which carriers of the virus may not show symptoms but are still contagious.</li>
					<li>Due to the COVID-19 incubation period, I may unknowingly pass on the COVID-19 virus to others. I also acknowledge that others may unknowingly pass on the COVID-19 virus to me.</li>
					<li>Due to the close contact nature of services provided by KOTM and characteristics of the virus, there is an elevated risk of transmission for COVID-19 (and other infectious diseases) despite the additional measures being taken by KOTM to prevent such transmission.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><strong>INFORMED CONSENT</strong>: By reading and agreeing to this document, I declare that I understand the inherent risks of my volunteer position with KOTM as it relates to COVID-19, and I bring no claim whatsoever upon KOTM as a result of my volunteering with KOTM.</p>
