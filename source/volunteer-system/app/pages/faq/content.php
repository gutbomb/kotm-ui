<h2>Thank You for Volunteering!!!</h2>

<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">What will I do at Childcare?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>During childcare, volunteers and children have open playtime together in a preschool classroom. Volunteers simply interact with the children, meaning you’ll be building with blocks, dressing up, eating delicious imaginary meals, etc. In good weather, we love playing outside. If not enough children show up or we have too many volunteers, you will have the option of going home or helping us disinfect toys and do other projects, if needed.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">What will I do at Respite?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>At Respite Care, each volunteer is paired with a specific child that they stay with for the night. All the pairs play at the respite location with staff overseeing them. The night largely depends on the child you are paired with and his/her interests and abilities, but it’s likely you’ll do a variety of activities - play in our ball pit and gym room, create with playdough, go outside, watch a movie, etc. If there are extra volunteers, two will be paired to a child.</p></div>

    <div class="faqQuestion">Is there any training or special orientation needed to volunteer at KOTM?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>There is no formal training required. At the beginning of your volunteer shift, staff will review our <a href="/volunteer-system/app/?page=volunteerRules">Rules and Policies</a> with you and provide all important information for your volunteer experience.</p></div>

<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">All the volunteering spots are full. When will there be more openings?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>The volunteer dates are updated at the beginning of each month to include the next month’s dates. For example, at the beginning of January the dates for all of February will be posted.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">I would like to bring a friend with me, but all the spots are filled the night I am volunteering?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>If your friend is over 18 years old, you may absolutely bring your friend, and she/he can fill out the volunteer paperwork at the front desk. If you want to volunteer together to watch one child, please let the Volunteer Supervisor or the Respite Care Manager know that you prefer to do that.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">May I bring my children?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>We ask that volunteers are 12+ years old for childcare and 16+ years old for Respite. We are willing to make exceptions for certain situations, dependent on a variety of factors. If you would like to discuss your situation, please call or email our volunteer coordinator at 385-292-5628, <a href="mailto:volunteer@kotm.org">volunteer@kotm.org</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">May I schedule a group to volunteer?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer">
        <p>If you are bringing a group to volunteer at Respite or Childcare, each person needs to sign up individually. This allows us to have the volunteer’s contact information, an emergency contact, and send reminders directly to the volunteer. We’ve also found that people are more committed to coming if they’ve signed up for themselves than if someone else commits them to a group.</p>
        <p>If you would like to bring a group to volunteer and Respite or Childcare isn’t the right fit or you have questions, contact the volunteer coordinator at 385-292-5628, <a href="mailto:volunteer@kotm.org">volunteer@kotm.org</a> to discuss alternatives. We would love to have your help!</p>
    </div>

<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">Are there projects that a group can do at another location and then return to KOTM?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>We have several projects that can be done outside of KOTM, as needed. Please contact the volunteer coordinator for details at 385-292-5628, <a href="mailto:volunteer@kotm.org">volunteer@kotm.org</a>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">Can I perform community service at KOTM?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>Yes, but there are some limits. To work with children, our Volunteer Agreement Form states “I affirm that I have never been involved in, charged with, or convicted of: child abuse, sexual abuse, domestic violence, assault, or any illegal sexual or violence related conduct” and “I affirm that in the past year I have not used any illegal drugs or abused alcohol or prescription medications”. If you cannot answer these two questions as yes or can be found on the National Sex Offender Public Website, you cannot work with children or in our facilities. However, you may be eligible to help with projects outside of  our facilities, such as advertising our Heber Half: Run for Autism.</p></div>

<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">Can I do homework while volunteering?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>It’s playtime! We hope that you will put away other distractions (phones included) and focus on the people you’re with and your volunteer experience.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">Do I need to bring anything or provide any toys, games, snacks, etc.?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>KOTM has all the things needed for you to have a successful volunteer experience.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">Do I need to wear any special clothing?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>Please wear comfortable shoes that you can move around in easily, and please avoid a lot of jewelry that could be grabbed onto by the children or caught on things.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqQuestion">May I bring my service animal?</div>
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p>The children receiving services at KOTM have a variety of health conditions and emotional needs. To avoid any possible complications, we ask that you do not bring your service animal.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="faqQuestionBlock">
    <div class="faqAnswer"><p><strong>Note:</strong> If any staff feel that a volunteer is not providing adequate or safe care to the children they are with, or that they are not “of clear mind” (see our Volunteer Agreement Form), Kids On The Move may ask the volunteer to leave.</p></div>
